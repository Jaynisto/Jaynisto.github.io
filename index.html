                <p>
                    Hi I am Fanie, A 24 year old Aspiring Agile Web Developer from Mpumalanga South Africa I started Coding 2018 using C++ but I spent a whole semester not getting it.
                    At 2020 I was coding with C, that's when I first got some interest in coding since I was enjoyong building different functions using my code. At 2021 I was using Java 
                    and I first made some few project with it, which was making a basic Calculator and a Website that takes in the user details straight to the database. For my database 
                    I was using mySQL. Late 2021 I heard about CodeX then that's when I Knew it was time for a change. I believe so much in Unity because
                    I know very well when we're together we can Achieve more and Peer to peer learning is the way. I will continue to learn till the very end.                </p>
