                <p>
                    Hi I am <strong>Fanie</strong>, A 24 year old Aspiring Agile Web Developer from Mpumalanga South Africa. I started Coding 2018 using C++, but I spent a whole semester not getting it.
                    At 2020 I was coding with C and that is when I first got some interest in Coding since I was enjoying making different functions using my code. At 2021 I was using Java 
                    and I first made some few project with it, which was making a basic Calculator and a Sweep South Website locally that takes in the user details straight to the database. For my database 
                    I was using mySQL. April 2021 I heard about CodeX, well that was when I Knew it was time for a change. I believe so much in Unity, this is simply because
                    I know very well when we're together as humans we can Achieve more and by helping one another that is where we grow individually. 
                    I consider myself to be a hard-working, teachable, diligent and a goal-driven individual who strives under pressure and enjoys new challenges.
                    I consider myself an ambitious, intellectual and a very eager person to learn. I will continue to learn till the very end.                
                </p>
